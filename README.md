# Purpose
To control personal income and expenses in a virtual way - hence My Wallet.
# Technology
I created the app using ReactJS; Typescript and Styled Components, as well as other native libraries inside React. 
# My Toughts
This application was a study case so I can learn the basics of the React Framework, it's a project that taught me a lot about states and hooks in ReactJS. 
I'm really with its functionality right now, maybe in the future I'll add more features.
